# BrainTech

BrainTech is an **early** innovative proof-of-concept (POC) project illustrating how tech consulting companies can leverage graphs for knowledge management and customer intelligence. This project extends my work at Kyndryl and leverages both real and synthetic data to create a comprehensive solution.

## Problem Statement

Tech consulting companies often face the following challenges:

- Siloed customer knowledge trapped in disparate documents (PowerPoints, Excel sheets, etc.)
- Critical customer insights locked behind a few key individuals (partners, business account managers)
- Difficulty in modeling and understanding the complex structures of large corporate clients
- Challenges in identifying pain points, strengths, and weaknesses of clients

In an increasingly competitive market, propositions that fail to resonate with a customer's unique needs are likely to fail.

## Solution

BrainTech offers a suite of powerful tools to address these challenges:

1. **Graph Visual Explorer**: Democratizes a consulting company's knowledge intuitively. Node relationships carry semantic meaning, making it easy to diffuse knowledge across the organization.

2. **In-depth Customer Dashboards**: Provide comprehensive analysis of client organizations.

3. **Advanced ML Capabilities**: Leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques for deeper insights.
## Unique Approach

- Applies graph technology to model B2B relationships, a novel approach in the industry.
- Combines graph technology with a customized ontology to connect internal and external data, enabling specialized use-cases not possible with traditional methods.
- Explores the powerful synergy between graph databases and recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs).
